# `Sagasu 3`

The long awaited

Also see [Sagasu]() and [Sagasu 2]().

...

## To do

* continue writing and iterating and testing scraper from sagasu 2 and sagasu 3, make it read from .env for now (then github secrets later)
* ensure can be run and write logs and screenshots as relevant
* then have it deploy a simple frontend via github pages for me to view
* look into alternatives to run the scraper whenever i call the frontend but limit number of calls a day on the frontend client side
* then write a simple frontend that is deployed via github pages instead of vercel similar to llmarena project for jsoh
* see whether this can be deployed also as a telegram app
* then furnish this README.md as required
* see whether i can apply booking functionality as an extension of this
